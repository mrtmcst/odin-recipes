        <li>750g duck (breast, legs)</li>
        <li>2tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup Ruby port wine</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>

        <li>300g Carolino rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a frying pan over high heat. Once hot, place the duck pieces with the fat facing down, fry on both sides until golden brown. Drain the fat into a bowl and keep it. Reduce the heat to medium, add in the port wine to deglaze.</li>
        <li>Transfer the duck and the liquid to a tall pot, place it over medium to high heat. Meanwhile, prepare the ingredients for the broth: chop one of the onions in half, peel the garlic cloves and chop the carrot into thick slices. Place it into the duck pot, add the chouriço and the bay leaf. Cover it with boiling water. Season it with salt and black pepper, and let it simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat, the bay leaf and the chouriço from the broth, and keep to one side.</li>
        <li>With a hand mixer, blend the broth until smooth. With a sieve, strain it into a jug.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place a medium saucepan (preferably with a thick bottom) over medium heat, add in the fat reserved at the beginning. Dice the remaining onion and fry it until translucent. Add in the rice, fry it for about 2 minutes, then add a litter of the broth. Cook it for about 25 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and the liquid absorbed.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven at 200°C, you can use the grill function if available with your oven.</li>
        <li>Remove the bones and skin from the duck, shred it. Slice the chouriço.</li>
        <li>In a small baking dish, layer half of the rice, add the duck meat and cover it with the remaining rice. Finish with a layer of chouriço slices. Pop It in the oven for 25 minutes.</li>
